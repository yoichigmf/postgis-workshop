Aggregate all city administrative area in region administrative area

```SQL
SELECT code_reg,
       ST_Union(geom) AS geom
FROM admin.commune
GROUP BY code_reg;
```

We now add a generated unique integer to allow QGIS DBManager to load the data :

```SQL
SELECT (row_number() OVER ())::integer AS gid, 
       code_reg,
       ST_Union(geom) AS geom
FROM admin.commune
GROUP BY code_reg;
```

Collect
-------

Same than previously, but now we use _ST_Collect_ instead of _ST_Union_

```SQL
SELECT (row_number() OVER ())::integer AS gid, 
       ST_CollectionExtract(ST_Collect(geom), 3) AS geom
FROM admin.commune
GROUP BY code_reg;
```

More collections
----------------

Like previously, but now we use _ST_CollectionHomogenize_ instead of _ST_CollectionExtract_

```SQL
SELECT (row_number() OVER ())::integer AS gid, 
       ST_CollectionHomogenize(ST_Collect(geom)) AS geom
FROM admin.commune
GROUP BY code_reg;
```

Merge lines
-----------

Retrieve a single river (Rhone) and aggregate all LINESTRING subparts in a single geometry

_ST_LineMerge_ interest :

```SQL
SELECT
   ST_Summary(ST_LineMerge(ST_CollectionExtract(ST_Collect(geom), 2))) AS geom,
   ST_Summary(ST_CollectionExtract(ST_Collect(geom), 2)) AS geom 
FROM hydro.cours_eau 
WHERE code_hydro = 'V---0000';
-- Hydrological code from Rhone river
;
```

Using _ST_LineMerge_ and view it through QGIS DBManager:

```SQL
SELECT 1::integer AS gid,
      ST_LineMerge(ST_CollectionExtract(ST_Collect(geom), 2)) AS geom
FROM hydro.cours_eau 
-- Hydrological code from Rhone river
WHERE code_hydro = 'V---0000';
;
```
